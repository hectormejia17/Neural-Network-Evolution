# Requirements
The project requires Unity3D version ``2019.2.8f1`` or later to run.

# Project Use
Within the Unity project editor:
- Courses 1 - 6 can be enabled. These courses gradually increase in complexity
- Population, mutation, and fitness can be edited in the inspector via the ``Factory`` object and the ``Runner Factory.cs`` script
- After each generation, the genetic algorithm saves new values to the ``Save Data`` folder
- At any time, the population weights and biases can be reset during runtime with the ``Reset`` button
